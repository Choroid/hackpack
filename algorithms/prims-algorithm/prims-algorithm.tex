\section{Prim's Algorithm}\index{graph!Prim's Algorithm}
Prims algorithm is a greedy algorithm that allows for finding a minimum spanning tree/forest in $O(E + \log{V})$ time.
Big picture, Prims algorithm works by doing the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Choose an arbitrary unvisited node in the graph.
	\item Grow the tree by choosing the node that can be added to the tree by least cost.
	\item Repeat step 2 until all connected nodes have been visited.  If there are still nodes, return to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Lessons Learned}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Typedefs can greatly improve readability of code
	\item Convince classes can greatly improve readability
	\item Directed graphs can be converted to undirected graphs by inserting the edge for both the source and the destination.
\end{itemize}
