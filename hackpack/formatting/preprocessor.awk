#!/usr/bin/awk

# MAKE SURE YOU MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE DESTRUCTIVELY RUNNING THIS SCRIPT ON ANYTHING!
#
# Preprocesses anything you want for use in differing hackpack versions.
# Run to standard output with:
#     awk -v V=(hackpack|hackpackpp) -f <this file> <file to process>
#
# Specifically, the script parses out #ifdef blocks. For example:
#
#     #ifdef hackpack
#        Slim and streamlined!
#     #endif
#     #ifdef hackpackpp
#        A tome of knowledge!
#     #endif
#
# ...would parse to just one of the two inner lines, depending on which option you
# pass in to the variable V.
