\section{Dynamic Programming}\index{Dynamic Programming}
Dynamic Programming is a powerful tool that can be applied to several different types of algorithms.
The basic idea is to save the results of smaller problems and use the results to solve larger problems.

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Improving runtimes of some other algorithms
	\item	Solving the knapsack in $O(n)$ time
	\item	Solving the integer knapsack in $O(nm)$ time
	\item	Solving the largest increasing subsequece in $O(n \log n)$ time
	\item	Solving the maximum value sub-array problem in $O(n)$
	\item	Solving the maximum value continuous sub-array problem
\end{itemize}
