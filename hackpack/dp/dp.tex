\section{Dynamic Programming}\index{Dynamic Programming}
Dynamic Programming is a powerful tool that can be applied to several different types of algorithms.\cite{dppractice}
The basic idea is to save the results of smaller problems and use the results to solve larger problems.

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Improving runtimes of some other algorithms
	\item	Solving the knapsack in $O(n)$ time
	\item	Solving the integer knapsack in $O(nm)$ time
	\item	Solving the largest increasing subsequece in $O(n \log n)$ time
	\item	Solving the maximum value sub-array problem in $O(n)$
	\item	Solving the maximum value continuous sub-array problem
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contest Problem, Knapsack}
Given a set of n items with size -- $s$ -- and value -- $v$ -- pack the items into a knapsack of capacity C such that the value of the items inside the knapsack is maximized.  The optimal solution is of the form:
$$M(j) = \max \left\{M(j-1), \max \left\{M(j - s_i) + v_i \right\}\right\}$$
Where $M(0) = 0$

\subsection{Contest Problem, Integer Knapsack}
A similar problem to the knapsack, except each item can be used at most once.  The solution here is to expand the state space.  The optimal solution is of the form
$$M(i,j) = \max \left\{ M(i-1, j) , M(i-1, j- s_i) + v_i \right\}$$
Where $M(0,j) = 0$ and $M(i,0) = 0$
