\section{Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Matching}\index{string matching}
This algorithm is a method of speeding up string searches by using mismatches to determine where a search should continue.
It is also commonly known as the KMP algorithm.

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{More efficient string searches}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contest Problem, The Fine Print}
Due to his excessive milking of the cows without appropriate compensation, Farmer John has, unsurprisingly, received an ultimatum from the cows.
If the two parties cannot come to an agreement, Farmer John risks internal insurgency.
Though he is willing to reduce his demands and compensate them with more grazing time, the document he has received is unbearably lengthy.

Farmer John can recall that, lately, the cows have been nagging him to build a swimming pool.
Likely, a condition has been added to force him to concede to building this pool.

To save Farmer John from a long night (he works early mornings) find out if anything about a 'pool' has been added anywhere.

\subsubsection{Input}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A single file whose name is passed in as a command line argument.

\subsubsection{Output}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The sentence containing 'pool' if it exists. It will always end in a period.
	\item The string ''The agreement does not mention a pool.'' if a sentence containing 'pool' doesn't exist.
