\section{Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Matching}\index{string matching}
This algorithm is a method of speeding up string searches by using mismatches to determine where a search should continue.
The KMP algorithm (as it is commonly known as) runs in $O(n)$ time.

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item More efficient string searches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contest Problem, The Fine Print}
Due to his excessive milking of the cows without appropriate compensation, Farmer John has, unsurprisingly, received an ultimatum from the cows.
If the two parties cannot come to an agreement, Farmer John risks internal insurgency.
Though he is willing to reduce his demands and compensate them with more grazing time, the document he has received is unbearably lengthy.

Farmer John can recall that, lately, the cows have been nagging him to build a swimming pool.
Therefore, it is likely that a condition has been added to force him to concede to building this pool.

To save Farmer John from a long night (he works early mornings) find out if anything about a 'pool' has been added anywhere.

\subsubsection{Input}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Text from standard input representing the legal document terminated with an EOF.
\end{itemize}
\lstinputlisting[label=The Fine Print Sample Input, caption=The Fine Print Sample Input, linerange={1-3,1366-1379}]{./algorithms/kmp-string-matching/problems/fine-print/fine-print.in}

\subsubsection{Output}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The sentence containing 'pool' if it exists. All sentences within the text end in a period.
	\item The string ''The agreement does not mention a pool.'' if a sentence containing 'pool' doesn't exist.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lessons Learned}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The KMP algorithm improves upon regular iterative string matching.
	\item Runs exactly like iterative string matching in the case of no prospective matches.
\end{itemize}
