Breadth first search is a method of searching a graph of nodes with edges of equal weight..
Ultimately, the search is implemented using a queue to visit nodes in the immediate neighborhood of the current node (nodes that are separated by only one edge).
Using this technique, the algorithm can find the shortest path from a given node to another node.
The running time of the algorithm can be described as $O(m + n)$ for a given graph containing $m$ nodes and $n$ edges.
