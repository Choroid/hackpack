\section{Depth First Search}\index{depth first search}
This algorithm is a search method for a graph or tree with the maximum length or depth between connecting data nodes is needed, and the connected nodes identified. 
A real world example of this is ping data from computer networks. 
The first operation of the method is to visit and inspect a root node on a graph or tree and track the node as visited.
The second operation is to add the rood or currently visited node to the to a stack.
The third operation is to access the neighbouring nodes of the root or currently visited node.
The fourth operation is to traverse to the unvisited child nodes of the root or currently visited node and check for unvisited nodes. 
Finally the fifth operation is to pop visited nodes from the stack that no longer have unvisited child nodes to traverse, the only exception being the deepest node.
Upon which the search is complete.
Unlike breath first search, the use of a stack or queue with depth first search allows the order of the nodes traversed be to be specified.
The traversal orders are pre-order, post-order, in-order.
