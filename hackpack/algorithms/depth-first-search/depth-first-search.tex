Depth-first search is a method of searching a graph for the possibility reaching a specified node.
As its name suggests, the algorithm will proceed from the starting node to the farthest node of a graph before branching to other nodes.
Because of this, depth-first search is \textbf{not} guaranteed to find the shortest path.
Rather, it will find \textbf{a} path if it exists.
Traversing an entire graph takes $\Theta (m + n)$ for a graph of $m$ vertices and $n$ edges.

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Testing if two graphs are connected by some common node.
	\item Discovering whether a specified state is possible with certain steps.
\end{itemize}
