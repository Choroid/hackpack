\section{Sieve of Eratosthenes}\index{sieve!Eratosthenes}\index{primes}
The sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, yet effective algorithm for generating primes less than around 10 million.
It works by iteratively eliminating (''sifting'') multiples of primes.
Numbers that are left are prime.
The algorithm runs in $O(n\log\log n)$ time.
