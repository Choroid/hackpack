\section{Hash Window Approaches}\index{hashing}\index{hash windows}
Hashing is a mapping of objects to bytes.
These bytes are often stored in Strings or numeric data types.
Normally, hash functions attempt to map each object to a \textit{unique} set of bytes.
Also a \textit{slight} change in the object should cause a \textit{large} change in the output.
When two objects map to the same set of bytes, it is referred to as a hash collision.

\subsection{Approaches}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify substrings quickly and cleanly.
	\item Hash collisions to detect certain features of the input.
\end{itemize}
