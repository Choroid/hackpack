\section{Dynamic Programming}\index{Dynamic Programming}
Dynamic Programming is a powerful tool that can be applied to several different types of algorithms.\cite{dppractice}
The basic idea is to save the results of smaller problems and use the results to solve larger problems.

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Improving runtimes of some other algorithms
	\item	Solving the knapsack in $O(nm)$ time
	\item	Solving the integer knapsack in $O(nm)$ time
	\item	Solving the largest increasing subsequece in $O(n \log n)$ time
	\item	Solving the maximum value sub-array problem in $O(n)$
	\item	Solving the maximum value continuous sub-array problem
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contest Problem, A Knapsack Full of Fireworks}\index{Knapsack}
The cows on Farmer John's Farm are planning a fireworks show for his birthday.

They have found all of the loose change from all over the farm and want to purchase fireworks to maximize the wow factor for their purchase.

Please help the cows determine the maximum wow factor they can get for their loose change.

\subsubsection{Input Format}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Line 1: One integer, $N$, $(1 \leq N \leq 100)$ the number of fireworks in the catalog,
	\item Line 2: One integer, $C$, $(1 \leq C \leq 10000)$ the number of cents that the cows found.
	\item Line 3..$(N+2)$ Two integers $P,W$ representing the price and wow factor for the fireworks.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sample Input}
\lstinputlisting{./approaches/dp/problems/knapsack/knapsack.in}

\subsubsection{Output Format}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Line 1: A single integer representing the maximum wow factor
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Sample Output}
\lstinputlisting{./approaches/dp/problems/knapsack/knapsack.out}

\subsubsection{Sample Solution}
\lstinputlisting{./approaches/dp/problems/knapsack/knapsack.cpp}

\subsubsection{Lessons Learned}
The optimal solution is of the form:
$$W(j) = \max \left\{W(j-1), \max \left\{W(j - p_i) + v_i \right\}\right\}$$
Where $W(0) = 0$

\subsection{Contest Problem, A Few Fireworks More}\index{Knapsack!Integer}
The Cows have reconsidered there original plan of buying just the fireworks with the greatest wow factor.

Instead they want to buy the most wow factor given they use each firework type at most once.

\subsubsection{Input}
You will be given the $N$ the number of fireworks in the catalog,
Followed by $C$ the number of cents that the cows found.
The input will then have the cost of each firework $P$ in cents followed by the wow factor of the firework $W$.

\subsubsection{Output}
Output the maximum wow factor as an integer

\subsubsection{Lesson Learned}
A similar problem to the knapsack, except each item can be used at most once.  The solution here is to expand the state space.  The optimal solution is of the form
$$M(i,j) = \max \left\{ M(i-1, j) , M(i-1, j- s_i) + v_i \right\}$$
Where $M(0,j) = 0$ and $M(i,0) = 0$
