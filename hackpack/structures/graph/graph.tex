\section{Graph}
Graphs are useful for a variety of different real world problems.
Graphs are comprised of Nodes and Edges.
Nodes represent a distinct state.
Edges represent the possible transitions between states.
Graphs can be directed(edges are one way) or undirected(edges are the same going to or from a node).

Paths are graphs that have no branches off.
Cycles are graphs that connect back on them selves.
Trees are graphs that contain no cycles.
Forests are graphs that contain multiple disjoint trees.
Bipartite Graphs have a set of "source" nodes and a set of "edge" nodes

Two nodes $i,j$ are said to be connected if there is a path from i to j.
Two nodes $i,j$ are said to be strongly connected if there is a directed path from i to j and j to i.

\subsection{Applications}
For all run times, $N$ is the number of nodes, and $M$ is the number of edges.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shortest Paths
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Breath First Search - Graphs with equal weight edges $O(N+M)$
            \item Dijkstra's Algorithm - Graphs with non-negative edges weights $O(N \log N)$.
            \item Bellman Ford - Graphs with some negative edges $O(N^3)$
            \item Floyd Warshall - Grahps with negative edges but not cycles $O(NM)$.
            \item Dynamic Programming - Directed Acyclic Graphs
        \end{itemize}
    \item Minimum Spanning Trees 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Prim's Algorithm - for undirected graphs; if run for each component, finds the minimum spanning forest$O(M \log N)$.
            \item Kruskal's Algorithm - for graphs; finds the minimum spanning forests in unconnected graphs $(M \log N)$
        \end{itemize}
    \item Similarity/Connectivity
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Depth First Search - Find (Strongly) Connected Components $O(N+M)$
            \item Depth First Search - Find a path from i to j $O(N+M)$
        \end{itemize}
    \item Topological Sorting 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Depth First Search - Use start and stop times to topologically sort $O(N+M)$
        \end{itemize}
    \item Matchings
    \item Flow/Routing
    \item Clustering
    \item Centrality
\end{itemize}
