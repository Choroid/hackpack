\section{Heap}\index{heap}\index{priority\_queue}
Heaps are very useful data structures that support at least the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Insert.
	\item Remove the smallest element.
\end{itemize}

Many other implementations also implement a decrease key operation and delete operation.

The standard library provides a two sets of functions that provide this functionality.
The first is the \lstinline{priority_queue} data structure found in the queue header.
The second is the \lstinline{make_heap} functions in found the algorithm header.
Neither of these implementations strictly implements the decrease key operation.
The code sample shown below shows how to create a binary min heap as well as the heap sort algorithm which runs in $O(N \log N)$ time.
