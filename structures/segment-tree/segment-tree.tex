It is often useful to be aware of the range properties of a given array, such as: prefix sums, suffix sums, range minimum queries, range maximum queries, etc.
For simpler problems, a secondary array may suffice to calculate a property like the prefix sum of an array.
The prefix sum calculation only takes $O(n)$ time to perform, and any query thereafter takes only $O(1)$ time.
But any updates to the source dataset will require $O(n)$ time to update the prefix sum calculations.
Frequent changes will quickly show the pitfall of this approach.
A segment tree is a data structure for storing information about intervals that can be constructed in $O(n \log(n))$ time.
Whenever the source data changes, update times stay low at $O(\log n)$ time.
